Welcome to my **C++ Applications** repository! This project contains various small programs designed to practice and demonstrate key concepts of C++ programming. These applications are practical, beginner-friendly, and focus on solving everyday problems.

## üåü Applications Included

1. **Basic Calculator**:  
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Currency Converter**:  
   - Convert values between USD and BRL with user-defined exchange rates.

3. **Area, Volume, and Radius Calculator**:  
   - Calculate the area and volume of shapes such as squares, rectangles, circles, and spheres.

4. **Fuel Consumption Tracker**:  
   - Calculate fuel consumption per kilometer based on distance traveled and fuel used.

5. **Intermediate Calculator**:  
   - A more advanced calculator capable of handling percentage calculations and power functions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Requirements

To run the programs in this repository, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code, or Code::Blocks).
